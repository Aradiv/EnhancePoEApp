# The PoE Chaos Recipe Enhancer

This App fetches data from PoE servers and shows which items you need to pick up for the Chaos Recipe. Optionally it manipulates your loot filter, so you can go full brain-dead while farming! While selling your stuff it shows you what items to put in your inventory in which order. No more using your brain at all!

## Installation

_**_NOTE: We will be updating the installation / setup guides in the near future to ensure you're up and running quicker._**_

DO NOT download the whole github repository, since it may include some new experimental features.

[Download the setup.msi here](https://github.com/kosace/EnhancePoEApp/releases) instead. 

Since this app is not trusted (too expensive), you will have to accept few times to install (Click on "More info" when Windows wants to protect your PC). 

If you have updated your application to 1.2.0 please use a new item filter as some changes may break your existing one! Make sure to back up any custom filters you want our program to interact with in case of any [potentially unwanted behavior!](https://github.com/kosace/EnhancePoEApp/issues/106)

## Guide

#### Compatibility

The overlays will not work in Fullscreen Mode. They will only work in:
 - Windowed Mode
 - Fullscreen Windowed Mode
 
The tool has been tested with Windows 10/11, we have no plans to officially support other operating systems.

Overlay only works with Display Scaling 100% in Windows Settings (working on a fix). 

#### Main Overlay

The Main Overlay shows each item type with its color and while fetching data it shows a loading bar. When you have enough items of a specific item type the image will grey out. If you have loot filter manipulation activated, this is the time to refresh your loot filter manually in-game. Also if you have sound activated, it will play to remember you to refresh your loot filter.

You can just drag the Main Overlay wherever you want, except if you set the opacity to 0 (better set it to 0.01).

 - Show Button: shows/ hides the Stash Tab Overlay
 - Fetch Button: starts fetching items from PoE servers periodically
 
There will be warning displayed in this overlay also:

 - Warning if you have full sets, but need lower item level items (item levels 60-74)
 - Warning if you have full sets and need to sell them
 - Warning if you have full exalted shard recipe set
 - Warning if you are temporarily banned from fetching from PoE servers
 - Warning if you exceeded the rate limit

#### Stash Tab Overlay

The stash tab Overlay highlights items in a specific order if you have full sets in a stash tab. No more wondering which part is missing when selling. Also this way you can put 2 sets in one inventory. Leave it open when selling! Otherwise the highlighting will start from beginning with items you already sold.

If you want to change position or size of the stash tabs Overlay, you have to press the "Edit" button on the Main Overlay. Then you can drag the Stash tabs Overlay around and resize it (bottom right corner), except if you set the opacity to 0 (better set it to 0.01). The TabHeader position and sizes can be modified in the Settings Page.

At the top of the overlay you can find the

 - Edit Button: makes the Stash Tab Overlay clickable and draggable

#### Loot Filter

You can use any loot filter you want. If you don't have the recognition phrase in your loot filter, the recipe rules will be added to the top of your existing loot filter (which overwrites some rules, working on a fix). When the recognition phrase is added, the app will only change the styles in within the phrases. That means you can decide where the recipe rules should be modified.

Don't forget to refresh your loot filter in-game everytime the item types change!

Please make a copy of your loot filter before using it.

#### **_Notes on manipulation of Online Loot Filters_**

So some updates on the filter manipulation: Local works just fine! Woo! ðŸ¥³

But... we're running into some limitations with the ONLINE Filter Manipulation.

Here's where we're at:
- Our program has no trouble manipulating the contents of the online filter
- Our program is successfully sending/saving those changes up to your profile (you can check for yourself after running a fetch)

Once your fetch is complete and your filter is updated on your profile (ONLINE, NOT in-game yet), you hit the reload filter button expecting the new filters to show up. They don't.

After hitting up the dev chat on TFT, I believe the cause is caching that is happening on the GGG side of things for your Loot Filters.

According to FilterBlade, they had to get special permission to implement their version of 'near real-time updates' for filters made on their site.

As a developer, I can completely understand their reasons for implementing a cache before hitting the database - it's faster and generally speaker easier a load on some of their services under the hood.

So, all that said, for the time being we won't be able to guarantee that ***ONLINE *** filter manipulation will work 100% with the new update. It may not even affect the lot of y'all unless you're hitting the set threshold you have set every couple of minutes.

Really sorry about this, y'all!

###### Recognition Phrases:
 - Chaos Recipe Start: "#Chaos Recipe Enhancer by kosace Chaos Recipe Start"
 - Chaos Recipe End: "#Chaos Recipe Enhancer by kosace Chaos Recipe End"
 
 - Exalted Recipe Start: "#Chaos Recipe Enhancer by kosace Exalted Recipe Start"
 - Exalted Recipe End: "#Chaos Recipe Enhancer by kosace Exalted Recipe End"
 
Don't "cross" them, meaning if you start one section end it before starting the other one.

You can change the look of the Chaos Recipe Section in "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\ChaosRecipeEnhancer\Styles\NormalItemsStyle.txt". 

You can change the look of the Exalted Recipe Section in "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\ChaosRecipeEnhancer\Styles\InfluencedItemsStyle.txt"

Unfortunately there is no possibility to automatically refresh your loot filter in-game (that are legal), so you will have to do that manually (2 clicks).

### Settings

#### Account Name

The name of your PoE account (not the character).

#### PoE Session ID

Login at PoE website and copy it from your cookies (press F12). Everytime you re-log at the website your SessionID gets refreshed. You can find an easy to use tutorial [here](http://www.vhpg.com/how-to-find-poe-session-id/). To prevent leaking your SessionID, it will only show dots.

Don't share your SessionID with anyone.

#### League

The league you are playing in.

- Normal: just the league name. e.g. "Standard" or "Heist"
- SSF: SSF + the league name e.g. "SSF Standard" or "SSF Heist"
- Hardcore: just "Hardcore"
- Event: the name under the character on poe website e.g. for Mayhem it was "Mayhem (DRE001)"

#### Full Set Threshold

This is the amount of sets you want to gather. The loot filter will hide items depending on this setting. For example: if you want 5 sets and have 5 body armours already, the loot filter will hide body armours. If you have this number of sets full, you should sell, otherwise every item will be hidden (except for jewellery). 

#### Refresh Rate

The time in seconds the tool waits between fetching the data. The tool will ask the servers every x seconds, no matter if you are in a map or in your hideout. The minimum time is 15 seconds, but I recommend setting it higher, especially if you have many stash tabs configured.

#### Fill Greedy

The tool tries to fit at least 1 item with item levels 60-74 in every set. Then it tries to fill the rest of the slots with higher item level items. When Fill Greedy is activated it will then fill the remaining slots with lower item level items again. When deactivated it will only allow 1 lower item level item in each set, that means it will save lower item level items for the next set. So you are more efficient when you are deactivating it while playing high tier maps.

#### Exalted Shard Recipe

When activated the tool will also look for influenced unidentified rare item sets, but it will never hide influenced items. When you have a full set, it will tell you in the Main Overlay.

#### Stash tab Mode

Switches the way how you configure your stash tabs. 
 - ID: let's you input a sequence of stash tab IDs. 
 - Prefix: let's you input a stash tab name prefix
 
#### Stash tab Indices
 
 Visible in ID Stash tab Mode. Enter all stash tab with their IDs that you want to fetch seperated with a comma. Indexes start at 0.
 
 For example: "0,1,3,4" fetches the first, second, 4th and the 5th stash tab.
 
#### Stash tab Prefix

Visible in Prefix Stash tab Mode. The tool will look for any stash tab that starts with that prefix and get the IDs automatically. 

For example: "Test" will fetch stash tabs named "Test" but also Stash tabs named "Testsldfjs"

#### Opacity Overlay

The opacity of the Main Overlay from 0 to 1 which means 0% to 100%.
 
#### Close to Tray

When you close the Settings page it will minimize to the tray instead of terminating the tool.

#### Overlay Mode

Switches the Main Overlay modes.

##### Standard

Shows each item type and optionally their amounts. 

##### Minified

Smaller version of the standard overlay. Click on the number of sets (left) to open Stash tab Overlay or click on "S" (right) to start/ stop fetching. 

Red Border means it is not fetching.
Green Border means it is fetching.

##### Only Buttons

Only shows each Button and the number of full sets.

#### Show Item Amounts

Only works in Standard Overlay Mode. Shows the amount of each item you have to fill full sets. Means if you have 5 helmets it shows you 5. But if you have 7 rings it shows you 3 because you can make 3 sets with 7 rings. Item levels will be ignored.

#### Hotkeys

Here you can set hotkeys for showing/ hiding the Main Overlay, Stash tab Overlay and for starting/ stopping the fetching to the servers. 

Although the tool is fully usable with mouse only, too.

#### Opacity Stash Tab Overlay

The opacity of the Stash tab overlay in general. Although if you want the borders of the item cells visible, set it to 1 and modify the Stash tab Background Color. There you can set opacity of the background.

#### Stash tab Background Color

Advantage of this is, that you can set opacity here too. Means you can have fully visible borders and still see your items in your stash tab.

The opacity is the 'A' of the RGBA.

#### Highlight Color

The color of the highlighting in Stash tab Overlay while selling.

#### Highlight Mode

 - Item by Item: shows you each item after another in the right order to fit 2 full sets in your inventory
 - Set by Set: shows you whole sets after each other. The right order to fit 2 full sets in your inventory will still be marked.
 - All Items: shows you every item in every full set. No order.
 
#### Tab Header Margin

The space from the left side of the window to your first tab header.

#### Tab Header Width

The width of each tab header.

#### Tab Header Gap

The space between each tab header.

#### Loot Filter Manipulation

Alters your loot filter every time you need to pick up other items. You still need to refresh your loot filter in-game manually. There is no legal way to do that for you.

#### Loot filter Location

Opens a file dialog. Pick any loot filter you want. Only shows .filter files. The standard location of PoE loot filters is: 

"/Username/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile/"

#### Colors

The colors of each item type that are written in your loot filter.

#### Notification Sound

Play a sound when you have to manually refresh your loot filter in-game and when you picked up a whole set in the Stash tab Overlay.

#### Sound Volume

The sound volume...

##  F.A.Q.

#### The tool seems to not pick the right stash tabs

Make sure you do NOT have "Remove-only Stash tabs" hidden. They will still be counted, even if you can't see them. That means the index will be off. 

This will also apply to Event Stash tabs. When you are playing in an event, check if you have Remove-only Tabs from events before. You can check your stash tab IDs by searching this address in your browser (replace YOURACCOUNTNAME and YOURLEAGUE accordingly):

https://www.pathofexile.com/character-window/get-stash-items?accountName=YOURACCOUNTNAME&league=YOURLEAGUE&tabs=1

It will output all your stash tabs currently available. 

#### The tool cannot find my account

If you are a steam user, make sure you have linked your steam account to your PoE account on the website

#### The highlighting in Stash Tab Overlay seems off

If you have changed your Display Scaling in Windows (Display Settings -> Scale and layout) it will not get the right mouse positions. Set it to 100%.

#### The highlighting in Stash tab Overlay shows items already sold

Make sure you do not close the overlay while selling. The data cannot be refreshed that fast, that means the tool calculates an order for picking the items out of your stash. This order will start from the beginning if you closed the overlay and did not fetch before. So just leave it open while selling.

#### The Stash tab Overlay is not aligned

You can align it yourself by going in edit mode. Press "Edit" on top of the Stash tab Overlay and drag the Stash tab Overlay (at the top) around. In the bottom right corner there is a grip to resize the Stash tab Overlay.

#### Is this tool safe?
You can check and compile the sourcecode for yourself, so it should be safe as long as you are downloading it from here. DO NOT download from any other locations and ensure you're downloading from our original repository.

#### Can I get banned for using this tool?
Well, I contacted GGG but as usual they don't answer any questions regarding legality of 3rd party tools. As this tool does not interfere with any game files directly, the answer is: probably no!

Although there are 2 points which could be problematic:
1. The tool fetches data from PoE servers repeatedly, so they could think you are stressing the servers too much. That is why I limited the refresh rate a bit. One request per one second. 
2. The tool manipulates your loot filter. I'm not sure if they are considered "game files" by GGG, personally I wouldn't consider them like that. The tool certainly doesn't interact with the game client in any way. But if you are unsure you can deactivate this feature and only use the overlay.

## Contributions

If you want to contribute to the project you can push changes to the "patches"-branch. Do not push to master please.

Best thing would be to join the discord though especially if you want to make bigger changes. There we can discuss how to do what.
Help is always appreciated since this is my starter project for WPF anyways.
